I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the College of Intelligence and Computing in [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/) (TJU) under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Feng](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/fengwei/index.html). 
I received my M.Eng degree from Tianjin University in 2019, supervised by Prof. Feng.
My research interest is visual intelligence, specifically including multi-camera video collaborative analysis, and visual object tracking.

I am lucky to have opportunities to work with Prof. [Song Wang](https://cse.sc.edu/~songwang/) (University of South Carolina) and Prof. [Liang Wan](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/lwan/index.html) (Tianjin University).
