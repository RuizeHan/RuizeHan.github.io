I am an assistant professor at Shenzhen University of Advanced Technology. I got my Ph.D. degree at the College of Intelligence and Computing in [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/) (TJU) under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Feng](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/fengwei/index.html), 2023. 
I received my M.Eng degree from Tianjin University in 2019, supervised by Prof. Feng. I was a research fellow at Shenshen Institutes of Advanced Technology and City University of Hong Kong.
My research interest is visual intelligence, specifically including multi-camera video collaborative analysis, visual object tracking and open-world/vocabulary object perception.
